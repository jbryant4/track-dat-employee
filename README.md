## Future Improvements

Due to a crazy week there are a couple issue with the code that i would like to fix if i get the time:

1) The bonus material is not complete and a little buggy
2) The 'view all roles' funciton does not display the departments name jsut id
3) The code itself could use some refractoring and clean up
4) Also would like to learn more about asyn/await funcitonallity
